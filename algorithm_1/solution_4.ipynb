    "The question specifically states \"4 players playing this game simultaneously,\" which means they must play at the same time, not sequentially as I suggested.\n",
    "\n",
    "1) When playing simultaneously:\n",
    "- All players roll at the same time\n",
    "- No information can be shared between rolls\n",
    "- All players incur their own costs independently\n",
    "- The game ends when any player wins\n",
    "\n",
    "2) Key considerations change:\n",
    "- No benefit from others' information (unlike sequential play)\n",
    "- All players face same probabilities at same time\n",
    "- First winner takes all ($100,000)\n",
    "- Others lose whatever they've invested\n",
    "- Once someone wins, others must stop\n",
    "\n",
    "3) Probability implications:\n",
    "- For any given set of rolls:\n",
    "  * P(at least one player wins) = 1 - P(all players lose)\n",
    "  * P(all players lose) = (215/216)⁴\n",
    "  * P(at least one wins) = 1 - (215/216)⁴\n",
    "\n",
    "4) Optimal Strategy with simultaneous play:\n",
    "\n",
    "a) Each player should:\n",
    "- Start rolling\n",
    "- If get first \"1\", continue (sunk cost principle)\n",
    "- If get two \"1\"s, definitely continue\n",
    "- Stop if accumulate too many failed attempts\n",
    "\n",
    "b) No communication strategy needed since:\n",
    "- All rolls happen simultaneously\n",
    "- Can't learn from others' outcomes\n",
    "- Can't coordinate attempts\n",
    "\n",
    "5) Group strategy becomes individual strategy because:\n",
    "- No information sharing possible\n",
    "- No turn order to optimize\n",
    "- Each player plays independently\n",
    "- First to win gets prize\n",
    "\n",
    "This is quite different from my previous answer! The simultaneous nature fundamentally prevent the game from one of information sharing and coordination to one of independent parallel attempts.\n",
    "\n",
    "This actually simplifies the strategy to: each player should follow their own optimal individual strategy (the one you found in questions 2-3), knowing that:\n",
    "- They have 1/4 chance of being the winner if someone wins\n",
    "- They must accept higher collective losses\n",
    "- No way to avoid duplicate costs\n",
    "- Must play aggressively since others are also trying"
